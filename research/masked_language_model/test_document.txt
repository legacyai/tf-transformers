Institution’s suggested total pretax savings goal of 15% of annual income (including employer contributions) is based on our research which indicates that most participants would need to contribute this amount from an assumed starting age of 25 through an assumed retirement age of 67, to potentially support a replacement annual income rate equal to 45% of pre-retirement annual income (assuming no pension income) through age 93).__||__This target is based on Consumer Expenditure Survey 2011 (BLS), Statistics of Income 2011 Tax Stat, IRS 2014 tax brackets and Social Security Benefit Calculators, as well as multiple market simulations using historical market data.
This target is based on Consumer Expenditure Survey 2011 (BLS), Statistics of Income 2011 Tax Stat, IRS 2014 tax brackets and Social Security Benefit Calculators, as well as multiple market simulations using historical market data.__||__This target does not take into consideration the specific situation of any particular participant, the composition of any particular account, or any particular investment or investment strategy.__||__Individual participants may need to save more or less than 15% depending on retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, assets saved to date, and other factors.__||__Institution believes that 10% is a good guideline for a minimum savings rate when pension incomes are unknown based on prior experience with participants’ financial plans.
Participants making Roth 401(k) contributions may have lower minimum savings rates.__||__For example, someone in the 25% tax bracket making a 12% pre-tax contribution could instead make a 9% Roth 401(k) contribution and for purposes of this metric would then be considered “off plan”.__||__For ”Asset Allocation“ purposes, the participant’s current age and equity holdings are compared with an example table containing age-based equity holding percentages based on an equity glide path.__||__The Institution Equity Glide Path is an example we use for this measure and is a range of equity allocations that may be generally appropriate for many investors saving for retirement and planning to retire around ages 65 to 67.
The Institution Equity Glide Path is an example we use for this measure and is a range of equity allocations that may be generally appropriate for many investors saving for retirement and planning to retire around ages 65 to 67.__||__It is designed to become more conservative as participants approach retirement and beyond.__||__The glide path as of [12/31/13] begins with 90% equity holdings within a retirement portfolio at age 25 continuing down to 24% equity holdings at age 93.__||__Equities are defined as domestic equity, international equity, company stock, and the equity portion of blended investment options.__||__The OnPlan Indicator for asset allocation is determined by being within 10% (+ or -) of the Institution Equity Glide Path and capped at 95% equity.
We assume self-directed account balances (if any) are allocated 75% to equities, regardless of participant age and so the OnPlan Indicator has limited applicability for those affected participants.__||__For purposes of this metric, participants enrolled in a managed account or invested greater than or equal to 80% of their account balance in a single target date fund are considered to be On Plan.__||__Participants whose total equity allocation of assets in their account is within the Institution Equity Glide path are likely to be On Plan.__||__Participants whose equity allocation is outside of this range may also be On Plan, depending on individual retirement planning and investment needs.
Some participants within the Institution Equity Glide Path Range may not be On Plan, depending on individual retirement planning and investment needs.__||__Investors should allocate assets based on individual risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and personal financial situation.__||__A particular asset allocation may be achieved by using different accounts or by using the same one across multiple accounts.__||__The Institution Equity Glide Path can be provided upon request.__||__Important additional information For Plan Sponsor or Investment Professional use only.__||__Institution Investments does not contribute to or endorse any statements made by a third-party entity.__||__Unless otherwise noted, the opinions or review assessments provided by a third-party shall not be construed as those of Institution Investments.
