Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mT5 model was presented in `mT5: A massively multilingual pre-trained text-to-text transformer
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11934>`_ by Linting Xue, Noah Constant, Adam Roberts, Mihir Kale, Rami Al-Rfou, Aditya
Siddhant, Aditya Barua, Colin Raffel.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The recent "Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer" (T5) leveraged a unified text-to-text format and scale to attain
state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of English-language NLP tasks. In this paper, we introduce mT5, a
multilingual variant of T5 that was pre-trained on a new Common Crawl-based dataset covering 101 languages. We describe
the design and modified training of mT5 and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on many multilingual
benchmarks. All of the code and model checkpoints*

Note: mT5 was only pre-trained on `mC4 <https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4>`__ excluding any supervised training.
Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is useable on a downstream task, unlike the original T5 model.
Since mT5 was pre-trained unsupervisedly, there's no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task
fine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix.

Google has released the following variants:

- `google/mt5-small <https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small>`__

- `google/mt5-base <https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-base>`__

- `google/mt5-large <https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-large>`__

- `google/mt5-xl <https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-xl>`__

- `google/mt5-xxl <https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-xxl>`__.
